	<p> <br/>Bhajan means what..?üö©<br/>

		Bhajan means concentration of mind. A bhajan is the amalgamation of words, meaning, thought, music - tone, rhythm, rhythm, instrument, tala in a bhajan. Because bhajans are accompanied by musical notes and sounds. Bhajan means remembrance of God, devotion. Kirtan Bhakti in Navvidhabhakti, Bhaja means music, oneness with Nad Brahma, singing of Saptasuras, glorification of divine power of God, contemplation of divine power, concentration. Bhajan means self-improvement, positive thinking, health of mind, forgetting physical ailments, developing intelligence, man forgets his sorrows.

  Nadabrahma allows the chanter to become attuned to the words of the Lord's name, its meaning and the tones required to pronounce it. A positive state of mind to forget the physical, mental, intellectual, spiritual troubles and eradicate the disease by experiencing the joy of their (oneness). Bhajans are the many forms of God's power. If one sits chanting the name of the supreme power manifested in different forms such that the name of each form is different, no bad thoughts come in the mind. Like Sant Tukaram Maharaj Vitthal, Vitthal, Pandurang used to be very quiet. If such a mind is fixed in one place, the power of the mind increases. The qualities of God are described by changing. At that time the form of that God stands before our eyes as it is and our mind delights in it. The same qualities are cultivated on the mind.

  Depression, negative thoughts, conduct have no place and the mind is filled with pure bliss in the form of God. Bhajan is the simplest form of devotion. Bhakti is invented in the mind by constant chanting of bhajans and the seeker can become one with the Lord. Just like if you think bad things in your mind, you get bad habits in your mind. Therefore, human action becomes bad. By chanting like that, one is constantly united with the Lord. Therefore, karma is also done well by him. Good thoughts lead to good behavior. Therefore, Bhajan should not be considered as a means of entertainment.

  But have you ever thought that God is really doing something bad to us or will do it?
  According to this, if we consider the accumulated karma, prarabdha, pleasures, then the scriptures say that the fruit of punishment is happiness and the fruit of sin is pain, it is certain. Further - Bhogs end only after suffering, then the sins that have been committed so far will have to be suffered. Be it past birth or future birth, enjoyment is the fruit of accumulation. A very good illustration of this is found in Sri Gurucharitra, right at the beginning with Sandipaka and his guru relationship. It is certain that one can postpone enjoyment but cannot completely destroy it.
  When we do Bhakti to God, what does God do, first He brings your pleasures in your way, first He ends your pleasures and then He closes them. Just as gold is put into a furnace and filtered so that the sediment goes away and only pure gold remains and then it can be made into any kind of jewelry, just as the soul is thrown into the furnace of karma and the Lord removes the sediment as Bhoga and then the one who remains sattvik is accepted by God as a devotee. .
  So, no matter how many difficulties and pains you face in life, never say to solve it, just join hands and give strength to enjoy this pleasure. He is a devout devotee, if you ask him to get rid of it, he will push that karma forward, but it is certain that he will have to suffer it again sometime. Indulgences are like a tumor of cancer, if the doctor does not remove the tumor completely, the disease continues to afflict again and again. Once the knot is rooted out, there is no question of re-emergence, just as the Karma is fulfilled, there is no question of suffering again.
  If pleasure comes, sorrow comes, distress comes, believe for sure that your devotion is emerging, and soon you will be freed from karmatri. Then devote more and more at such times, surely better days will come soon...üôèBhagwant Samarth

  Saints, you must think about this.<br/><br/>


  üå≤When we come to Gurucharani, we come, we don't come! "He" God "sends" to us Gurucharis as He has predestined.
  Then we should remain steadfast there with undivided attention. Once established, it is our duty to maintain our conduct as directed by the Guru,
  Serving the Guru, doing the Sadhana given by the Guru "regularly", should not be interrupted, and should not be missed as much time as possible, because as we begin to do the Sadhana regularly,
  "Gurudev is waiting for us at that time". Once this feeling is rooted in the mind, the consistency in Sadhana automatically starts. I didn't sleep today, I don't feel well today
  So don't miss the tool time. It is very important to remember that we have got the feet of the great Guru because of his compassion towards us. Rest of the Gurus from us
  There is no expectation. They are looking at how to strengthen their feelings towards God. Our worldly problems will automatically go away when we firmly follow their steps. them
  Needless to say, we should have that much faith and loyalty towards them. They are with us, only our faith and loyalty is constant
  Checks. They are testing us on every occasion that happens in our life, where our "loyalty" is wavering, isn't it! So by always remembering him
  Face the events that happen in life. They take all our burdens as their loyalty. We only have to take care of our behavior and thoughts. It's wrong anywhere, anytime
  Shouldn't be. Our "guru" should be perceived by others through our conduct. If you manage to do so much, the Guru will bless you. What they "want" from you
  There is no harm in thinking that we will be truly fixed on Guruchari on the day we will know and correct our conduct accordingly.*üåπüôè

		  Do charity with faith.
We came to human birth, we came only to attain God. Hitherto I wandered many vaginas, God now brought me into the human vagina. Even after confessing 'Lord, I will not forget you now', if we are not born, we immediately ask 'Who are you?' I started saying that! Saints remind us that we have come to God by confessing 'that is me'. But even if the saints wake us up, we again pull the cover from our face, what should we do about it? It is difficult to wake up one who pretends to be asleep. Made many pilgrimages but remained the same; Why is the fault of the Ganga mine? 'Many people come to the banks of the Ganges, take bath, perform puja, then how can we say that this is Kali Yuga?' Said one. The other one said, 'This will be shown in front of you. A bloodthirsty man is sitting in front. He who is not a sinner should touch him, so that his blood will go away. But it will happen that if the person who commits adultery is a sinner, he will become a bloodthirsty of that person.' After realizing that, he started to spread from there slowly! That is, such a devoted, learned, daily bather of Gangamai, but no one thought that his heart was purified! At that time, a poor farmer was coming to Varhadkad, wrapped in a blanket and carrying a stick in his hand. His loyalty is such that one bathes in the Ganga, all sins are destroyed. He plunged into the Ganges and came up to meet the sick man; And surprisingly, the disease of the patient was cured! Such poor, naive people, what comes to them with superstition, does not help even great scholars. We have many superstitions in practice. When leaving home to work, we have a superstition that we will reach on time. Sometimes we can't reach Kacheri due to unforeseen reasons, but we keep trusting! In practice, as much loyalty as we give to each other, even if we give as much to God, God will give us satisfaction. Altruism should be done with full understanding, or should be done with insane faith. But we are partial; That is, not fully knowing but feeling like we know it. Such a person is very suspicious and very difficult to satisfy. A person who knows that something is true but cannot put it into practice is truly ignorant. Those who have improved with experience are wise!

168. There is no need for superstition in altruism. But there is no way to walk without faith.
